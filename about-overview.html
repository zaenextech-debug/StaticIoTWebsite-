        <strong>BSc Electronic Engineering</strong> student with

      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        We started as a small, engineering-first studio focused on rigorous PCB design and dependable
        firmware. That discipline now powers client products across consumer, industrial, and research domains.
      </p>
      <p>
        From <strong>schematic to certification</strong>, we design for EMC, manufacturability and test.
        On the software side, we build fast, safe firmware and the cloud pieces that keep fleets healthy in the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clients come to us when they want
        <strong>clear documentation, predictable delivery</strong> and practical guidance
        to reach manufacturing without surprises.
