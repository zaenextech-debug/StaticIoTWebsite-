      <p class="about-lead">
        Turning ideas into reliable electronics. I’m a
        <strong>BSc Electronic Engineering</strong> student with
        <strong>2+ years</strong> hands-on experience in Embedded & IoT
        and over <strong>3 years</strong> of lab and project experience,
        delivering production-ready solutions.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Story</h3>

      <p>
        We started as a small, engineering-first studio focused on rigorous
        PCB design and dependable firmware. That discipline now powers
        client products across consumer, industrial, and research domains.
      </p>

      <p>
        From <strong>schematic to certification</strong>, we design for EMC,
        manufacturability, and test. On the software side, we build fast,
        secure firmware and cloud systems that keep devices healthy in the field.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clients choose us for
        <strong>clear documentation</strong>,
        <strong>predictable delivery</strong>, and practical engineering
        guidance — without manufacturing surprises.
